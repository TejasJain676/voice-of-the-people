<div class="three-cols">
<div class="box"><h4>Keeping The Surroundings Clean</h4><p>Maintaining a clean environment is a collective citizen responsibility that goes beyond government efforts, starting with conscious individual actions. The most crucial contribution is proper waste management, which involves avoiding littering, using designated waste bins, and practicing Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle to minimize landfill contribution. Furthermore, citizens should actively participate in and organize community clean-up drives for public spaces like parks and streets, and advocate for local policies and services that promote cleanliness. By conserving natural resources, planting trees to increase greenery, reporting illegal dumping or vandalism, and educating others on sustainable and hygienic practices, every citizen plays a vital role in fostering a healthier, more pleasant, and safer community for all.</p></div>
