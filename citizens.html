<h1>Civic Duties</h1>
<div class="three-cols">
<div class="box"><h4>Keeping The Surroundings Clean</h4><p>Keeping our environment clean is a job for all of us, not just the government. The best thing you can do is to stop littering and always use the right trash bins. We need to focus on reducing what we use, reusing things instead of throwing them away, and recycling everything we can. Join or start a community clean-up event in your park or street; it’s a simple way to make a big difference right where you live. By planting trees, saving water, and showing others how to be clean, you become a real hero for your neighborhood and planet. Your small daily habits create a huge, clean change!</p></div>
<div class="box"><h4>Vote Responsibly</h4><p>Voting is your most powerful tool in our country, so you must use it wisely. Before you vote, it’s your job to learn about the people who are running and what they plan to do. Don't just listen to rumors; read up on the facts to make an informed choice. Make sure you are registered to vote and that you actually show up to the polls for every election—local and national. When you vote, you are choosing the leaders who will make decisions for everyone. When you vote responsibly, you are actively shaping a better future for your community.</p></div>
<div class="box"><h4>Road Safety</h4><p>Keeping our roads safe is a shared responsibility that begins with every driver, pedestrian, and cyclist following the rules. The most crucial thing citizens must do is to be attentive and predictable: always follow speed limits, never drive or walk distracted (put the phone away!), and never drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs. As drivers, this means respecting traffic signals and signs, and always wearing your seatbelt. As pedestrians and cyclists, this means using crosswalks, wearing bright clothing, and obeying traffic lights. By reporting dangerous driving or poor road conditions and teaching younger generations about safe practices, every person helps create a culture of care and reduces accidents. Your focus and caution on the road save lives!</p></div>
<div class="box"><h4>Plant Trees</h4><p>Planting trees is one of the easiest and best ways citizens can help the environment right now. Trees are essential because they clean the air we breathe by soaking up carbon dioxide and releasing fresh oxygen. They also help fight climate change, reduce local temperatures, and provide homes for wildlife like birds and insects. When you plant a tree, you're not just adding greenery; you're helping prevent soil erosion, improving local water quality, and making your neighborhood more beautiful and peaceful. Every single tree makes a difference, so grab a shovel and become a builder of a greener, healthier future!</p></div>
<div class="box"><h4>Help Community</h4><p>Being a supportive citizen means actively working to make your local area a better place for everyone. The simplest way to help is to volunteer your time to local causes, whether it’s assisting at a food bank, mentoring a student, or helping clean up a local park. Look out for your neighbors, especially the elderly or those who need extra support, by offering small help like running errands or checking in on them. Attend local meetings and speak up about things that matter, encouraging everyone to get involved. By sharing your skills, showing kindness, and building strong, trusting relationships with those around you, you create a truly vibrant and resilient community where everyone feels connected and valued.</p></div>
