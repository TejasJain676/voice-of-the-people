<br>
<h4>Start Request:</h4> Click on the "Submit Request" option. You will be prompted to read and agree to the guidelines.
<br>
<h4>Fill the Form:</h4> Select the correct Ministry/Department from the dropdown menu.

<h4>Enter Personal Details:</h4> Fill in your personal information (Name, Address, Mobile Number, Email ID).

<h4>Write the Application:</h4> In the "Text for RTI Request application" box, clearly and simply state the exact information you are seeking. Be specific and keep the text concise (usually limited to 3000 characters).

<div class="box"><h4>Community Action</h4><p>Community Action isn't just a nice idea—it's your power in motion! It's the moment when you and your neighbors stop waiting for change and start building it yourselves. By stepping up together, you can solve local problems that no single person could tackle, whether it’s making your streets safer with a neighborhood watch or ensuring every kid has food through a local drive. When you share your time and skills, you're not just volunteering; you're weaving a stronger, warmer fabric for your whole area. This collective spirit doesn't just fix things; it gives everyone a voice and a stake in the future. Be the spark: Organize, connect, and let your united community action be the unstoppable force that turns your neighborhood dreams into reality!</p></div>
