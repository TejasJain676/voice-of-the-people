<h2>Know Your Rights</h2>
<div class="three-cols">
<div class="box"><h4>Right to Information</h4><p>The Right to Information (RTI) is a powerful tool designed to empower every citizen and hold the government accountable. It gives you the legal right to ask for and receive information held by any public authority, such as government departments, agencies, and public institutions.

The government's duty under the RTI Act is threefold:

Transparency: To proactively publish key information about its decisions, budgets, and work so that you don't always have to ask for it.

Responsiveness: To designate Public Information Officers (PIOs) who are legally required to reply to your information requests in a timely manner, usually within 30 days.

Accountability: To ensure all government workings, finances, and project details are open to public review, thereby fighting corruption and inefficiency.

By using your right to information, you are not just curious—you are becoming an informed participant in democracy, ensuring public money is spent wisely and services are delivered correctly. The government works for you, and RTI is your right to check their work!</p></div>
