<h1>Government Responsibilities</h1>

<section>
<h2>Know Your Rights</h2>
<div class="three-cols">
<div class="box"><h4>Right to Information</h4><p>The Right to Information (RTI) is a powerful tool designed to empower every citizen and hold the government accountable. It gives you the legal right to ask for and receive information held by any public authority, such as government departments, agencies, and public institutions.
The government's duty under the RTI Act is threefold:
<br><br>
Transparency: To proactively publish key information about its decisions, budgets, and work so that you don't always have to ask for it.
<br><br>
Responsiveness: To designate Public Information Officers (PIOs) who are legally required to reply to your information requests in a timely manner, usually within 30 days.
<br><br>
Accountability: To ensure all government workings, finances, and project details are open to public review, thereby fighting corruption and inefficiency.
<br><br>
By using your right to information, you are not just curious—you are becoming an informed participant in democracy, ensuring public money is spent wisely and services are delivered correctly. The government works for you, and RTI is your right to check their work!</p></div>
<div class="box"><h4>Right to Equality</h4><p>The Right to Equality is a fundamental principle that ensures fairness and justice for every person in the country. It means that the government cannot treat people differently based on factors like their religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth—everyone is equal before the law. The government's core duty under this right is to abolish discrimination and ensure that all its policies, laws, and decisions apply equally to all citizens. This right also means that all citizens must have equal opportunity in public employment and that the government must actively work to remove social inequalities. By upholding this right, the government guarantees that no one is above the law and that every individual has the chance to thrive without unfair barriers.</p></div>
<div class="box"><h4>Freedom of Speech</h4><p>The Freedom of Speech and Expression is the lifeline of any true democracy, and the government has a fundamental duty to protect it. This right guarantees that every citizen can freely share their thoughts, opinions, and ideas—whether through speaking, writing, art, or peaceful protest—without fear of punishment from the state. The government's core responsibility is to create a climate where open discussion thrives and to ensure that people can criticize leaders and policies without being silenced.
<br><br>
However, this right is not absolute; the government also has the duty to put in reasonable limits to protect everyone else. This means they can step in only when speech directly threatens public order, national security, decency, or when it incites immediate violence or defamation against another person. The duty of the government is to protect your voice, while also ensuring that freedom is used responsibly and safely for the good of all.</p></div>
